An exmaple of how to use lower level constructs to build an altrnative implementation of Tiff Image provider.
the [ModernTiffImageHandler](./src/lib/ModernTiffImageHandler.h) class has uses the higher level functioanlity of libtiff, to achieve a simpler implementation that supports TIFF transparency. Check out [cli.cpp]((./src/cli.cpp)) to see a usage example.
